Python-script (the basis for system of recognition)

This small script: 
- takes an image file (test.png),
- cuts the desired part and stores it in a temporary file (tmp_pic.jpg)
- Then letters and numbers from this temporary file are recognized 
  and data stored in the file (out.txt)

This is a basic script based on which you can build a more sophisticated recognition system.
